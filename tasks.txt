Some notes and bugs from 12/1

@replies should have special highlighting in tweet panel
scroll bar in tweet panel is messed up
we should be polling the service to pull back updates automatically
longer tweets are getting cut off. We need to display full message.
main.xml and main2.xml have to be merged
